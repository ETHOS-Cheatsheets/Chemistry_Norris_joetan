\subsection{5.1 Intermolecular Forces}
1. \textbf{Van der Waals Forces (weak)}:\\
a. \textbf{London Dispersion Force}: Instantaneous charge fluctuations leading to repelling and attraction between atoms (always present). Big and long molecules have high dispersion\\
b. \textbf{Dipole-Dipole}: Sum of all dipole moments from polarbonds $\longrightarrow$ molecular dipole (present in polar molecules)\\
\vspace{1pt}\\
2. \textbf{Hydrogen Bonding (substantial)}:\\
Occurs between N, O, F atoms and H, which is attracted to unbonded e's of highly EN atoms\\
\vspace{1pt}\\
3. \textbf{Ion-Dipole Interactions}: Dipoles of polar molecules orient themselves with positive and negative ions (present in ionic solid dissolved in polar liquids)\\

\textbf{Strength}: London Dispersion Force $\simeq$ Dipole-Dipole < H-Bonding < Ion-Dipole
